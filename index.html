                page is only on the list itself, without additional distracting elements, which is proof. But the list
                itself is poorly formatted - due to a large amount of text, the exact update date for specific
                platforms is not visible, which is why you have to read everything. Because the whole article is heavily
                filled with text - it's difficult to quickly read key-changes for the user.

                large display of the representative of the class already at the stage of the site section immerses you
                in the atmosphere of the game. Coins: tabs with classes go beyond the viewport border,
                especially when switching between them, because the content inside the tab pushes the tabs lower -
                and you need to constantly scroll back and forth.

                and answer itself. I would do the alignment not in the center, but on the right, since there is a lot of
                text in the faq, and it is more difficult to read centered text due to torn lines from both edges.

                inserted not as a link, but as a direct video from YouTube. The FAQ is designed as a bullet list, which
                is confusing - you need to remove the markers, make the questions bold, and leave the answers as the
                rest of the text - so the user will immediately understand that it is a faq in front of him and not a
                list of something random.
